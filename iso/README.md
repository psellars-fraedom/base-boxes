### What Is This Directory For?

~~You should download your Windows ISO images from TechNet/MSDN and place them in this folder~~.

ISOs should be obtained from local shared storage and copied to the `iso` folder. We need to do this because MSDN / TechNet are protected by Microsoft (Live) ID, which does not support HTTP basic authentication or the OAuth2 username / password flow.

Currently implemented ISOs are:

* Windows 8.1 Enterprise with Update (x64)
    * File Name: en_windows_8.1_enterprise_with_update_x64_dvd_6054382.iso
    * Local Storage Location: `U:/Dev Environment/MSDN/Windows 8.1/`
    * SHA1 Hash: B7DD748446D89B9449A160CDC24BD282989BBD96
